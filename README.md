# Introduction

Hey hello friends welcome to another article , In this article I will introduce a home-automation PCB ,which I have design mainly for beginners.
When I was a beginner, I faced lot of problem , some time wiring got wrong ,some time just wrong connections and like that.
When we want to make any home-automation system , we will use a micro-controller generally Arduino boards  and a relay module.
we use jumper wires to connect them. and this way a simple home-automation system will become bulky with messy and loos wiring, 

I have designed this home-automation PCB , which will easily attached with your Arduino board.thats it your home-automation system is ready ,no need of any relay module or  any messy and loss wiring.Just attached this PCB on the Arduino uno board and your home-automation system is ready to use.
This PCB has inbuilt universal IR receiver sensor.So we could easily control our home-appliances through any IR remote. and this PCB also has slot for bluetooth module. So we can also control our home-appliances through bluetooth using smartphone. 


By using this PCB shield  we can make small and reliable home-automation system. and overall system will become so small and compact that this whole system could fit inside your electrical switch board. So we don't need any extra space to install this home-automation system.
